This Python code implements the classic FizzBuzz programming challenge. It iterates through a sequence of numbers and prints specific outputs based on divisibility rules:

"FizzBuzz": For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
"Fizz": For numbers divisible by 3 only.
"Buzz": For numbers divisible by 5 only.
The number itself: For numbers not divisible by 3 or 5
